This file is used to mark the tradingview directory as a Python package,
allowing you to import modules and classes from it.
When you import a package, the __init__.py file is run,
which can initialize package-wide settings or import the necessary classes
and functions from other files in the package.

__all__: This variable is used in a module (or package) to define
a list of public objects that will be imported when a client
imports the module using a wildcard (e.g., from some_module import *).
If not defined, the wildcard import will import
all objects that are defined in the module.
By defining __all__, you can control what gets imported
and prevent private objects from being unintentionally imported.
